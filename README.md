# QuickNAT-keras
Implementation of QuickNAT for brain tumor segmentation using Keras library with tensorflow as backend. The QuickNAT is a fast and accurate segmentation model. The model has been implemented along with the Unpooling and a combined loss function of dice score and weighted cross-entropy as described in the paper.
